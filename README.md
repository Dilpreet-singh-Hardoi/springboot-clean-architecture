# springboot-clean-architecture
Clean Architecture with Spring Boot is a design pattern that divides concerns into four layers: domain (core), application (use cases), infrastructure (data access, external services), and presentation (controllers, APIs), ensuring that business logic is independent of frameworks, databases, and user interface technologies.   The Domain Layer contains essential business entities, rules, and interfaces (such as User and Order). There are no external dependencies.  The Application Layer implements use cases (such as PlaceOrder) that orchestrate business logic through domain entities and gateways.  The infrastructure layer provides concrete implementations (such as JPA repositories and REST clients) for gateways defined in the application layer.  The Presentation Layer handles incoming requests (e.g., REST controllers), translates DTOs to domain models, and returns responses through presenters.
